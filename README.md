## Git Steps

`git status` Will show the "Differences" (Things that changed from last commit)

`git add .` Will add all the changes to get them ready for commit (Usually it's better to do file by file, but for a project like this we should be fine)

`git commit -am "Some message"` Sets a message relevant to what we are commiting

`git push` Will send the commit to Github
